## Data Structures Challenge
In this challenge, we're exploring data structures in Python. Your task is to implement a stack data structure by completing the `Stack` class. The `Stack` class should have the following methods:

- `__init__(self)`: Constructor that initializes an empty stack.

- `push(self, item)`: Method that adds an item to the top of the stack.

- `pop(self)`: Method that removes and returns the item at the top of the stack.

- `peek(self)`: Method that returns the item at the top of the stack without removing it.

You need to implement the methods `__init__`, `push`, `pop`, and `peek` in the `Stack` class.
